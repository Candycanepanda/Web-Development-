✏️ Character Counter Web Apps
This repository contains two beginner-friendly web applications built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Each project focuses on a simple functionality: **counting the number of characters typed** into a textarea.


📌 Description
These mini web projects demonstrate two approaches for counting characters typed by a user:
- index.html: Displays the number of characters **in real-time** as the user types.
- index2.html: Displays the character count **after clicking a button**.
These examples are useful for understanding basic DOM manipulation, JavaScript event listeners, and dynamic web UI design.
