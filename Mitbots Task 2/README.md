✏️ Character Counter Web App (with Limit)

This repository contains beginner-friendly web applications built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing different ways to count characters typed into a textarea.

📌 Description

This project demonstrates two mini web apps with simple yet useful functionality:

- index.html: Real-time character counter.
- index2.html: Button-triggered character count.
- index-limit.html: Real-time counter with character limit enforcement and alert when the limit is exceeded.

Each version is designed to help learners understand DOM manipulation, event listeners, and basic UI interactions using JavaScript.
